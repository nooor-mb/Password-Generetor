 This Java program creates secure passwords based on user choices. Users enter a length (6-64 characters) and select character types: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols. If the input is invalid, the program sets the length to 12 by default. If no character types are chosen, it automatically includes lowercase letters and numbers.
 The program uses SecureRandom to generate strong random characters and StringBuilder to build the password efficiently. The getYesOrNo() method ensures users enter only 'y' or 'n' for valid input. I got those functions from the internet and youtube videos. A loop picks random characters from the selected options until the password reaches the required length.
 Mostly I used if statements to ensure the rightness of the program, also used while statement to check if the inputs from the user does much or not. 
 Improvements include better input validation and  error handling to make it simpler. The program runs entirely in the console and does not use files, displaying the password directly without storing it for added security.
 This program is easy to use, secure, and reliable, making password generation quick and efficient.
